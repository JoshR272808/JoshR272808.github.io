# Joshua Robles's Portfolio

I am a computer science student and I expect to graudute in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
*Lab 1
  Since this was my first lab, I liked how it introduced all the basic tools we'll use in the course. Cloning a repository from GitHub and making changes was fun and gave me a sense of how version control works. I also liked using VS Code for the first time; it made editing C++ code easier with features like error highlighting.This lab helped me get comfortable with Linux, Git, GitHub, and VS Code. I also learned how to use clang++ to compile C++ code, which was helpful in future labs.

*Lab 5 
  I liked how this lab challenged me to work with multiple files in a project, which felt like a more realistic development process. Writing if statements to implement domain logic was an interesting way to apply what Iâ€™ve learned so far. I also appreciated using unit tests and system tests to check my work and improve my code.This lab helped me understand how to structure a project using multiple files and how to convert integers to doubles in C++. I also learned how important it is to use tests in development to make sure the code is working as expected, which will help me in future projects.

*Lab 9 
  I enjoyed learning how to work with files in C++, especially reading from and writing to files. It was satisfying to see my code interact with actual data stored in files. I also found it useful to implement error handling, as it taught me how to manage problems that can arise during file operations.This lab helped me understand how to read from and write to files in C++, and how to handle I/O errors gracefully. These skills are important for creating more robust programs that can manage data and deal with unexpected issues effectively.
